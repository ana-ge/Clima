#  Clima

It's an app which allows us to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. Also we have a dark mode in this app. I tried to implement my knowledges of UITextField, delegate patterns, protocols and extensions. Also i parsed JSON with native Encodable and Decodable protocols, URL sessions and Core Location to get our current location from the phone GPS.
